# MVCH Database Design

View Database_Manual.docx to learn more about this database.

To install the database, you must run each sql file in this order. 

A batch file for the user was under production but we were unable to get it functional due to restrictions on the machines we were using.

Files to run:

1. Drop.sql
2. createTables.sql
3. insertInfo.sql

This was the final project for the database course I took.

Collaborators: Jacob McCrae, Manuel Chu, and Harwin Jhand
