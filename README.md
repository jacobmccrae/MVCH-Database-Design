# MVCH Database Design

To install the database, you must run each sql file in this order. 
A batch file for the user was under production but we were unable to get it functional due to restrictions on the machines we were using.

Files to run:
Drop.sql
createTables.sql
insertInfo.sql

This was the final project for the database course I took.
Collaborators: Jacob McCrae, Manuel Chu, and Harwin Jhand
